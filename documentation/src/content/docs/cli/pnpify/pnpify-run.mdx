Run a command with a virtual node_modules folder

</div>

## Usage
<Code code="yarn pnpify run" lang="bash" />

## Examples
<p>Run Angular using PnPify
:</p>
<Code code="yarn pnpify ng build" lang="bash" />

## Details
When a non-PnP-compliant project tries to access the `node_modules` directories 
(for example through `readdir` or `readFile`), PnPify intercepts those calls and 
converts them into calls to the PnP API. Then, based on the result, it simulates 
the existence of a virtual `node_modules` folder that the underlying tool will 
then consume - still unaware that the files are extracted from a virtual 
filesystem.

The `run` keyword can be omitted if the executed command doesn't conflict with 
built-in commands.
