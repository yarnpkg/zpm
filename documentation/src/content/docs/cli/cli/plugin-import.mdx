## Details
This command downloads the specified plugin from its remote location and updates 
the configuration to reference it in further CLI invocations.

Three types of plugin references are accepted:

- If the plugin is stored within the Yarn repository, it can be referenced by 
name.

- Third-party plugins can be referenced directly through their public urls.

- Local plugins can be referenced by their path on the disk.

If the `--no-checksum` option is set, Yarn will no longer care if the plugin is 
modified.

Plugins cannot be downloaded from the npm registry, and aren't allowed to have 
dependencies (they need to be bundled into a single file, possibly thanks to the 
`@yarnpkg/builder` package).
