import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<div className="subtitle">
add all yarn files to your vcs

</div>

## Usage
<Code code="yarn stage" lang="bash" />

## Examples
<p>Adds all modified project files to the staging area
:</p>
<Code code="yarn stage" lang="bash" />

<p>Creates a new commit containing all modified project files
:</p>
<Code code="yarn stage --commit" lang="bash" />

## Details
This command will add to your staging area the files belonging to Yarn 
(typically any modified `package.json` and `.yarnrc.yml` files, but also 
linker-generated files, cache data, etc). It will take your ignore list into 
account, so the cache files won't be added if the cache is ignored in a 
`.gitignore` file (assuming you use Git).

Running `--reset` will instead remove them from the staging area (the changes 
will still be there, but won't be committed until you stage them back).

Since the staging area is a non-existent concept in Mercurial, Yarn will always 
create a new commit when running this command on Mercurial repositories. You can 
get this behavior when using Git by using the `--commit` flag which will 
directly create a commit.
