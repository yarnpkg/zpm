import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<div className="subtitle">
run node with the hook already setup

</div>

## Usage
<Code code="yarn node ..." lang="bash" />

## Examples
<p>Run a Node script
:</p>
<Code code="yarn node ./my-script.js" lang="bash" />

## Details
This command simply runs Node. It also makes sure to call it in a way that's 
compatible with the current project (for example, on PnP projects the 
environment will be setup in such a way that PnP will be correctly injected into 
the environment).

The Node process will use the exact same version of Node as the one used to run 
Yarn itself, which might be a good way to ensure that your commands always use a 
consistent Node version.
