import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<div className="subtitle">
explain a set of peer requirements

</div>

## Usage
<Code code="yarn explain peer-requirements [hash]" lang="bash" />

## Examples
<p>Explain the corresponding peer requirement for a hash
:</p>
<Code code="yarn explain peer-requirements p1a4ed" lang="bash" />

<p>List all peer requirements
:</p>
<Code code="yarn explain peer-requirements" lang="bash" />

## Details
A peer requirement represents all peer requests that a subject must satisfy when 
providing a requested package to requesters.

When the hash argument is specified, this command prints a detailed explanation 
of the peer requirement corresponding to the hash and whether it is satisfied or 
not.

When used without arguments, this command lists all peer requirements and the 
corresponding hash that can be used to get detailed information about a given 
requirement.

**Note:** A hash is a six-letter p-prefixed code that can be obtained from peer 
dependency warnings or from the list of all peer requirements (`yarn explain 
peer-requirements`).
