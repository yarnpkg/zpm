import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<div className="subtitle">
run a package in a temporary environment

</div>

## Usage
<Code code="yarn dlx <command> ..." lang="bash" />

## Examples
<p>Use create-vite to scaffold a new Vite project
:</p>
<Code code="yarn dlx create-vite" lang="bash" />

<p>Install multiple packages for a single command
:</p>
<Code code="yarn dlx -p typescript -p ts-node ts-node --transpile-only -e &quot;console.log('hello!')&quot;" lang="bash" />

## Details
This command will install a package within a temporary environment, and run its 
binary script if it contains any. The binary will run within the current cwd.

By default Yarn will download the package named `command`, but this can be 
changed through the use of the `-p,--package` flag which will instruct Yarn to 
still run the same command but from a different package.

Using `yarn dlx` as a replacement of `yarn add` isn't recommended, as it makes 
your project non-deterministic (Yarn doesn't keep track of the packages 
installed through `dlx` - neither their name, nor their version).
