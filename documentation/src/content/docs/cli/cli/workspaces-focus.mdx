<div className="subtitle">
Install a single workspace and its dependencies

</div>

## Usage
<Code code="yarn workspaces focus ..." lang="bash" />

## Details
This command will run an install as if the specified workspaces (and all other 
workspaces they depend on) were the only ones in the project. If no workspaces 
are explicitly listed, the active one will be assumed.

Note that this command is only very moderately useful when using zero-installs, 
since the cache will contain all the packages anyway - meaning that the only 
difference between a full install and a focused install would just be a few 
extra lines in the `.pnp.cjs` file, at the cost of introducing an extra 
complexity.

If the `-A,--all` flag is set, the entire project will be installed. Combine 
with `--production` to replicate the old `yarn install --production`.
