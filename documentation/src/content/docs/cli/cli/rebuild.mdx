import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<div className="subtitle">
rebuild the project's native packages

</div>

## Usage
<Code code="yarn rebuild ..." lang="bash" />

## Examples
<p>Rebuild all packages
:</p>
<Code code="yarn rebuild" lang="bash" />

<p>Rebuild fsevents only
:</p>
<Code code="yarn rebuild fsevents" lang="bash" />

## Details
This command will automatically cause Yarn to forget about previous compilations 
of the given packages and to run them again.

Note that while Yarn forgets the compilation, the previous artifacts aren't 
erased from the filesystem and may affect the next builds (in good or bad). To 
avoid this, you may remove the .yarn/unplugged folder, or any other relevant 
location where packages might have been stored (Yarn may offer a way to do that 
automatically in the future).

By default all packages will be rebuilt, but you can filter the list by 
specifying the names of the packages you want to clear from memory.
