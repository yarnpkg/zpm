import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<div className="subtitle">
check that the project constraints are met

</div>

## Usage
<Code code="yarn constraints" lang="bash" />

## Examples
<p>Check that all constraints are satisfied
:</p>
<Code code="yarn constraints" lang="bash" />

<p>Autofix all unmet constraints
:</p>
<Code code="yarn constraints --fix" lang="bash" />

## Details
This command will run constraints on your project and emit errors for each one 
that is found but isn't met. If any error is emitted the process will exit with 
a non-zero exit code.

If the `--fix` flag is used, Yarn will attempt to automatically fix the issues 
the best it can, following a multi-pass process (with a maximum of 10 
iterations). Some ambiguous patterns cannot be autofixed, in which case you'll 
have to manually specify the right resolution.

For more information as to how to write constraints, please consult our 
dedicated page on our website: https://yarnpkg.com/features/constraints.
