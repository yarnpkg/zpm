<div className="subtitle">
apply a new version to the current package

</div>

## Usage
<Code code="yarn version <strategy>" lang="bash" />

## Examples
<p>Immediately bump the version to the next major
:</p>
<Code code="yarn version major" lang="bash" />

<p>Prepare the version to be bumped to the next major
:</p>
<Code code="yarn version major --deferred" lang="bash" />

## Details
This command will bump the version number for the given package, following the 
specified strategy:

- If `major`, the first number from the semver range will be increased 
(`X.0.0`).

- If `minor`, the second number from the semver range will be increased 
(`0.X.0`).

- If `patch`, the third number from the semver range will be increased 
(`0.0.X`).

- If prefixed by `pre` (`premajor`, ...), a `-0` suffix will be set (`0.0.0-0`).

- If `prerelease`, the suffix will be increased (`0.0.0-X`); the third number 
from the semver range will also be increased if there was no suffix in the 
previous version.

- If `decline`, the nonce will be increased for `yarn version check` to pass 
without version bump.

- If a valid semver range, it will be used as new version.

- If unspecified, Yarn will ask you for guidance.

For more information about the `--deferred` flag, consult our documentation 
(https://yarnpkg.com/features/release-workflow#deferred-versioning).

any single member of your team inside the same project - by doing this you 
ensure that you have control over Yarn upgrades and downgrades (including on 
your deployment servers), and get rid of most of the headaches related to 
someone using a slightly different version and getting different behavior.

The version specifier can be:

- a tag:

- `latest` / `berry` / `stable` -> the most recent stable berry (`>=2.0.0`) 
release

- `canary` -> the most recent canary (release candidate) berry (`>=2.0.0`) 
release

- `classic` -> the most recent classic (`^0.x || ^1.x`) release

- a semver range (e.g. `2.x`) -> the most recent version satisfying the range 
(limited to berry releases)

- a semver version (e.g. `2.4.1`, `1.22.1`)

- a local file referenced through either a relative or absolute path

- `self` -> the version used to invoke the command
