import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<div className="subtitle">
check that all the relevant packages have been bumped

</div>

## Usage
<Code code="yarn version check" lang="bash" />

## Examples
<p>Check whether the modified packages need a bump
:</p>
<Code code="yarn version check" lang="bash" />

## Details
**Warning:** This command currently requires Git.

This command will check that all the packages covered by the files listed in 
argument have been properly bumped or declined to bump.

In the case of a bump, the check will also cover transitive packages - meaning 
that should `Foo` be bumped, a package `Bar` depending on `Foo` will require a 
decision as to whether `Bar` will need to be bumped. This check doesn't cross 
packages that have declined to bump.

In case no arguments are passed to the function, the list of modified files will 
be generated by comparing the HEAD against `master`.
