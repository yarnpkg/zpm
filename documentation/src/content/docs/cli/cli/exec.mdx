<div className="subtitle">
execute a shell script

</div>

## Usage
<Code code="yarn exec <commandName> ..." lang="bash" />

## Examples
<p>Execute a single shell command
:</p>
<Code code="yarn exec echo Hello World" lang="bash" />

<p>Execute a shell script
:</p>
<Code code="yarn exec &quot;tsc & babel src --out-dir lib&quot;" lang="bash" />

## Details
This command simply executes a shell script within the context of the root 
directory of the active workspace using the portable shell.

It also makes sure to call it in a way that's compatible with the current 
project (for example, on PnP projects the environment will be setup in such a 
way that PnP will be correctly injected into the environment).
