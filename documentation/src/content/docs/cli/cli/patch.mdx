import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<div className="subtitle">
prepare a package for patching

</div>

## Usage
<Code code="yarn patch <package>" lang="bash" />

## Details
This command will cause a package to be extracted in a temporary directory 
intended to be editable at will.

Once you're done with your changes, run `yarn patch-commit -s path` (with `path` 
being the temporary directory you received) to generate a patchfile and register 
it into your top-level manifest via the `patch:` protocol. Run `yarn 
patch-commit -h` for more details.

Calling the command when you already have a patch won't import it by default (in 
other words, the default behavior is to reset existing patches). However, adding 
the `-u,--update` flag will import any current patch.
