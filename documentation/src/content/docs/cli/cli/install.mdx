<div className="subtitle">
install the project dependencies

</div>

## Usage
<Code code="yarn install" lang="bash" />

## Examples
<p>Install the project
:</p>
<Code code="yarn install" lang="bash" />

<p>Validate a project when using Zero-Installs
:</p>
<Code code="yarn install --immutable --immutable-cache" lang="bash" />

<p>Validate a project when using Zero-Installs (slightly safer if you accept external PRs)
:</p>
<Code code="yarn install --immutable --immutable-cache --check-cache" lang="bash" />

## Details
This command sets up your project if needed. The installation is split into four 
different steps that each have their own characteristics:

- **Resolution:** First the package manager will resolve your dependencies. The 
exact way a dependency version is privileged over another isn't standardized 
outside of the regular semver guarantees. If a package doesn't resolve to what 
you would expect, check that all dependencies are correctly declared (also 
check our website for more information: ).

- **Fetch:** Then we download all the dependencies if needed, and make sure that 
they're all stored within our cache (check the value of `cacheFolder` in `yarn 
config` to see where the cache files are stored).

- **Link:** Then we send the dependency tree information to internal plugins 
tasked with writing them on the disk in some form (for example by generating 
the `.pnp.cjs` file you might know).

- **Build:** Once the dependency tree has been written on the disk, the package 
manager will now be free to run the build scripts for all packages that might 
need it, in a topological order compatible with the way they depend on one 
another. See https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/lifecycle-scripts for detail.

Note that running this command is not part of the recommended workflow. Yarn 
supports zero-installs, which means that as long as you store your cache and 
your `.pnp.cjs` file inside your repository, everything will work without 
requiring any install right after cloning your repository or switching branches.

If the `--immutable` option is set (defaults to true on CI), Yarn will abort 
with an error exit code if the lockfile was to be modified (other paths can be 
added using the `immutablePatterns` configuration setting). For backward 
compatibility we offer an alias under the name of `--frozen-lockfile`, but it 
will be removed in a later release.

If the `--immutable-cache` option is set, Yarn will abort with an error exit 
code if the cache folder was to be modified (either because files would be 
added, or because they'd be removed).

If the `--refresh-lockfile` option is set, Yarn will keep the same resolution 
for the packages currently in the lockfile but will refresh their metadata. If 
used together with `--immutable`, it can validate that the lockfile information 
are consistent. This flag is enabled by default when Yarn detects it runs within 
a pull request context.

If the `--check-cache` option is set, Yarn will always refetch the packages and 
will ensure that their checksum matches what's 1/ described in the lockfile 2/ 
inside the existing cache files (if present). This is recommended as part of 
your CI workflow if you're both following the Zero-Installs model and accepting 
PRs from third-parties, as they'd otherwise have the ability to alter the 
checked-in packages before submitting them.

If the `--inline-builds` option is set, Yarn will verbosely print the output of 
the build steps of your dependencies (instead of writing them into individual 
files). This is likely useful mostly for debug purposes only when using 
Docker-like environments.

If the `--mode=<mode>` option is set, Yarn will change which artifacts are 
generated. The modes currently supported are:

- `skip-build` will not run the build scripts at all. Note that this is 
different from setting `enableScripts` to false because the latter will 
disable build scripts, and thus affect the content of the artifacts generated 
on disk, whereas the former will just disable the build step - but not the 
scripts themselves, which just won't run.

- `update-lockfile` will skip the link step altogether, and only fetch packages 
that are missing from the lockfile (or that have no associated checksums). 
This mode is typically used by tools like Renovate or Dependabot to keep a 
lockfile up-to-date without incurring the full install cost.
