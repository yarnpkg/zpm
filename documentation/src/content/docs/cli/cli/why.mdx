import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<div className="subtitle">
display the reason why a package is needed

</div>

## Usage
<Code code="yarn why <package>" lang="bash" />

## Examples
<p>Explain why lodash is used in your project
:</p>
<Code code="yarn why lodash" lang="bash" />

## Details
This command prints the exact reasons why a package appears in the dependency 
tree.

If `-R,--recursive` is set, the listing will go in depth and will list, for each 
workspaces, what are all the paths that lead to the dependency. Note that the 
display is somewhat optimized in that it will not print the package listing 
twice for a single package, so if you see a leaf named "Foo" when looking for 
"Bar", it means that "Foo" already got printed higher in the tree.
