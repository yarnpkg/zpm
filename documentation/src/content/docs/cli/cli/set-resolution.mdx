import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<div className="subtitle">
Enforce a package resolution

</div>

## Usage
<Code code="yarn set resolution <descriptor> <resolution>" lang="bash" />

## Examples
<p>Force all instances of lodash@npm:^1.2.3 to resolve to 1.5.0
:</p>
<Code code="yarn set resolution lodash@npm:^1.2.3 npm:1.5.0" lang="bash" />

## Details
This command updates the resolution table so that `descriptor` is resolved by 
`resolution`.

Note that by default this command only affect the current resolution table - 
meaning that this "manual override" will disappear if you remove the lockfile, 
or if the package disappear from the table. If you wish to make the enforced 
resolution persist whatever happens, edit the `resolutions` field in your 
top-level manifest.

Note that no attempt is made at validating that `resolution` is a valid 
resolution entry for `descriptor`.
