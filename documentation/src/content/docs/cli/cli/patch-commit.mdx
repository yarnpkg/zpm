import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<div className="subtitle">
generate a patch out of a directory

</div>

## Usage
<Code code="yarn patch-commit <patchFolder>" lang="bash" />

## Details
By default, this will print a patchfile on stdout based on the diff between the 
folder passed in and the original version of the package. Such file is suitable 
for consumption with the `patch:` protocol.

With the `-s,--save` option set, the patchfile won't be printed on stdout 
anymore and will instead be stored within a local file (by default kept within 
`.yarn/patches`, but configurable via the `patchFolder` setting). A 
`resolutions` entry will also be added to your top-level manifest, referencing 
the patched package via the `patch:` protocol.

Note that only folders generated by `yarn patch` are accepted as valid input for 
`yarn patch-commit`.
