remove dependencies from the project

</div>

## Usage
<Code code="yarn remove ..." lang="bash" />

## Examples
<p>Remove a dependency from the current project
:</p>
<Code code="yarn remove lodash" lang="bash" />

<p>Remove a dependency from all workspaces at once
:</p>
<Code code="yarn remove lodash --all" lang="bash" />

<p>Remove all dependencies starting with `eslint-`
:</p>
<Code code="yarn remove 'eslint-*'" lang="bash" />

<p>Remove all dependencies with the `@babel` scope
:</p>
<Code code="yarn remove '@babel/*'" lang="bash" />

<p>Remove all dependencies matching `react-dom` or `react-helmet`
:</p>
<Code code="yarn remove 'react-{dom,helmet}'" lang="bash" />

## Details
This command will remove the packages matching the specified patterns from the 
current workspace.

If the `--mode=<mode>` option is set, Yarn will change which artifacts are 
generated. The modes currently supported are:

- `skip-build` will not run the build scripts at all. Note that this is 
different from setting `enableScripts` to false because the latter will 
disable build scripts, and thus affect the content of the artifacts generated 
on disk, whereas the former will just disable the build step - but not the 
scripts themselves, which just won't run.

- `update-lockfile` will skip the link step altogether, and only fetch packages 
that are missing from the lockfile (or that have no associated checksums). 
This mode is typically used by tools like Renovate or Dependabot to keep a 
lockfile up-to-date without incurring the full install cost.

This command accepts glob patterns as arguments (if valid Idents and supported 
by [micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch)). Make sure to escape 
the patterns, to prevent your own shell from trying to expand them.
