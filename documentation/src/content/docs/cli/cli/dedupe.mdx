<div className="subtitle">
deduplicate dependencies with overlapping ranges

</div>

## Usage
<Code code="yarn dedupe ..." lang="bash" />

## Examples
<p>Dedupe all packages
:</p>
<Code code="yarn dedupe" lang="bash" />

<p>Dedupe all packages using a specific strategy
:</p>
<Code code="yarn dedupe --strategy highest" lang="bash" />

<p>Dedupe a specific package
:</p>
<Code code="yarn dedupe lodash" lang="bash" />

<p>Dedupe all packages with the `@babel/*` scope
:</p>
<Code code="yarn dedupe '@babel/*'" lang="bash" />

<p>Check for duplicates (can be used as a CI step)
:</p>
<Code code="yarn dedupe --check" lang="bash" />

## Details
Duplicates are defined as descriptors with overlapping ranges being resolved and 
locked to different locators. They are a natural consequence of Yarn's 
deterministic installs, but they can sometimes pile up and unnecessarily 
increase the size of your project.

This command dedupes dependencies in the current project using different 
strategies (only one is implemented at the moment):

- `highest`: Reuses (where possible) the locators with the highest versions. 
This means that dependencies can only be upgraded, never downgraded. It's also 
guaranteed that it never takes more than a single pass to dedupe the entire 
dependency tree.

**Note:** Even though it never produces a wrong dependency tree, this command 
should be used with caution, as it modifies the dependency tree, which can 
sometimes cause problems when packages don't strictly follow semver 
recommendations. Because of this, it is recommended to also review the changes 
manually.

If set, the `-c,--check` flag will only report the found duplicates, without 
persisting the modified dependency tree. If changes are found, the command will 
exit with a non-zero exit code, making it suitable for CI purposes.

If the `--mode=<mode>` option is set, Yarn will change which artifacts are 
generated. The modes currently supported are:

- `skip-build` will not run the build scripts at all. Note that this is 
different from setting `enableScripts` to false because the latter will 
disable build scripts, and thus affect the content of the artifacts generated 
on disk, whereas the former will just disable the build step - but not the 
scripts themselves, which just won't run.

- `update-lockfile` will skip the link step altogether, and only fetch packages 
that are missing from the lockfile (or that have no associated checksums). 
This mode is typically used by tools like Renovate or Dependabot to keep a 
lockfile up-to-date without incurring the full install cost.

This command accepts glob patterns as arguments (if valid Idents and supported 
by [micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch)). Make sure to escape 
the patterns, to prevent your own shell from trying to expand them.

### In-depth explanation:

Yarn doesn't deduplicate dependencies by default, otherwise installs wouldn't be 
deterministic and the lockfile would be useless. What it actually does is that 
it tries to not duplicate dependencies in the first place.

**Example:** If `foo@^2.3.4` (a dependency of a dependency) has already been 
resolved to `foo@2.3.4`, running `yarn add foo@*`will cause Yarn to reuse 
`foo@2.3.4`, even if the latest `foo` is actually `foo@2.10.14`, thus preventing 
unnecessary duplication.

Duplication happens when Yarn can't unlock dependencies that have already been 
locked inside the lockfile.

**Example:** If `foo@^2.3.4` (a dependency of a dependency) has already been 
resolved to `foo@2.3.4`, running `yarn add foo@2.10.14` will cause Yarn to 
install `foo@2.10.14` because the existing resolution doesn't satisfy the range 
`2.10.14`. This behavior can lead to (sometimes) unwanted duplication, since now 
the lockfile contains 2 separate resolutions for the 2 `foo` descriptors, even 
though they have overlapping ranges, which means that the lockfile can be 
simplified so that both descriptors resolve to `foo@2.10.14`.
