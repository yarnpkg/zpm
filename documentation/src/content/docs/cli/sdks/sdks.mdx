generate editor SDKs and settings

</div>

## Usage
<Code code="yarn sdks" lang="bash" />

## Examples
<p>Generate the base SDKs
:</p>
<Code code="yarn sdks base" lang="bash" />

<p>Generate the base SDKs and editor settings for supported editors
:</p>
<Code code="yarn sdks vscode vim" lang="bash" />

<p>Update all generated SDKs and editor settings
:</p>
<Code code="yarn sdks" lang="bash" />

## Details
This command generates a new directory, `.yarn/sdks`, which includes the base 
SDKs.

When used without arguments, it:

- throws an error on non-pnpified projects

- updates all existing SDKs and editor settings on already-pnpified projects

The optional integrations arguments are a set of supported integrations, or the 
keyword `base`.

- When `base` is used, only the base SDKs will be generated. This is useful for 
when an editor is not yet supported and you plan to manage the settings 
yourself.

- When a set of integrations is used (e.g. `vscode`, `vim`, ...), the base SDKs 
will be installed plus all the settings relevant to the corresponding 
environments (for example on VSCode it would set `typescript.tsdk`).

The supported integrations at this time are: `vim`, `vscode`.

**Note:** This command always updates the already-installed SDKs and editor 
settings, no matter which arguments are passed.
