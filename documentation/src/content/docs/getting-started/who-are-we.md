Yarn is an open-source package manager for JavaScript and TypeScript projects. We aim to provide fast, reliable, and secure way to dependency management, without sacrificing flexibility, ease of use, or ethos.

Specifically, we focus on the following things:

- **Our users should be in control**; Yarn will not telling everything is fine if something is wrong. It will let you know of potential issues and suggest how to address them, but you'll be in the driver's seat.

- **Our messaging must be clear and concise**; a Yarn install should never take more than a dozen lines in your terminal, and you should trust the tool that the information we print is topical.

- **We are and will remain open-source first**; Yarn isn't proprietary, and it will never be spun into a VC-funded startup. The work we do is at the service of our beliefs and community rather than profit.

- **Strong opinions, well documented**; the JavaScript dependency management ecosystem has been under-specified for a while, and various concepts weren't well explained. Yarn aims to fill this gap by providing clear guidelines on how our tools are intended to work.
