Yarn is intended to be used with [Yarn Switch](/concepts/switch), a tool letting you use different Yarn versions depending on the project you're working on.

```bash
curl -sS https://repo.yarnpkg.com/install | bash
```

:::caution
You will likely have to restart your terminal session for the changes to take effect.
:::

Once Yarn Switch is ready, just initialize a new project:

```bash
yarn init
```

## Updating Yarn

Any time you'll want to update Yarn to the latest version, just run:

```
yarn set version latest
```

Yarn will then configure your project to use the most recent stable binary.
