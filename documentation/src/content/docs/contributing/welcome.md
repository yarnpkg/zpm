Are you interested in contributing to Yarn? This guide will help you get started!

While the older codebase, codenamed Berry, was written in TypeScript, the newer codebase, codenamed ZPM, is written in Rust. Using a native language comes with both challenges and advantages.

**Challenges:**

- Every platform needs to be distributed.
- Higher contribution bar.

**Opportunities:**

- No runtime dependencies outside of the system itself.
- Control over performances.

While we believe that the benefits will outweight the negative aspects, we also want to ensure that the community is well-supported and that everyone can contribute to the project. For this reason we have written various articles to explain the architecture of ZPM, and how to contribute to it.
