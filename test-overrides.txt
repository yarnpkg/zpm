Plug'n'Play ► it should properly forward the NODE_OPTIONS environment variable
    Since ESM loaders are in a separate thread, they run `-r` on their own and asynchronously. As a result
    an additional `42` is printed after the main process exits when the ESM loader is enabled, which is always
    the case on zpm.

Features ► Resolutions ► it should support overriding a packages with another, but only if it originally resolved to a specific reference
    This test, despite its name, doesn't actually checks that we only overrides a specific resolved version. Instead,
    it checks that we only overrides a specific _exact original range_. This capability is removed as it's both
    confusing and quite useless.
